\section{System}
Report on the integration of the voltage regulator and temperature sensing circuitry. 
Report on noise levels and how the temperature sensor will fit into the system (E.g. what the calibration will look like and what the the measurement error will be given the range, quantisation error and noise). 

\section{Lessons learnt}
Write down at least three of the most important things you have learnt in Assignment 1.
